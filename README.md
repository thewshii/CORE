# CORE

CORE is an innovative React Native application developed using Expo, crafted to enhance workflow management for both drivers and passengers. It facilitates smooth navigation within the app through React Navigation and features secure authentication using Supabase for the login and registration processes.

## Overview

The application's architecture combines React Native for cross-platform mobile app development, Expo for streamlined development lifecycle management, and React Navigation for seamless in-app navigational experiences. Supabase is integrated for robust authentication mechanisms. The app is differentiated for two primary user roles: drivers and passengers, each with tailored dashboards and functionalities for an optimized user experience.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes Supabase for user authentication, ensuring secure login and registration.
- **Role-based Dashboards**: Post-authentication, users select their role (driver or passenger), which directs them to their respective dashboards equipped with relevant functionalities.
- **Driver Dashboard**: Drivers gain access to navigation via a map view and a personal profile page.
- **Passenger Dashboard**: Passengers are provided with a map view for location tracking, a booking system for ride reservations, and a profile page.
